# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest? the smallest number would be 5 and largest would be 20.

# What did you see on line 2? 7
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest? smallest would be 3 and largest would be 9
# Could line 2 have produced a 4? No, as it is starting at 3 as a starting value and going up by 2 only producing odd numbers from there on.

# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest? 2.5 would be smallest and 5.5 would be largest.
