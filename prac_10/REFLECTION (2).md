# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was very random, I could be close to my assumed times or way later than them but normally it would be within 15 minutes.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I found myself getting a good gauge for how long it takes me to complete a task, over the course of the subject I was able to improve my estimate on how long it'd take me to complete.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned if I setup a deadline before the actual deadline and commit to it I can finish whatever task at hand before that deadline arrives.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I didn't recieve any practical reviews through github, though I did recieve feedback from my peers that helped me improve upon mistakes I made or constantly made, this overtime helped me learn better naming conventions or better/efficient methods for lines of code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I didn't get any feedback @'s once I couldn't leave a code review. But from  privately reviewing and giving feedback on peers work in person I was able to help fix small mistakes or suggest something they may be missing to help them fix mistake that they didn't noticed. I learned that it is common for everyone to make mistakes they weren't aware of and it's okay to create mistakes as they can be corrected.


Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[]()

### Explanation

I didn't get any feedback @'s once I couldn't leave a code review.


### Good Code Review 2

[]()

### Explanation

I didn't get any feedback @'s once I couldn't leave a code review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I think the practicals are fine overall, but the 2 random practicals with assignment level coding questions were abit much and a pain to handle.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I was able to sumbit something for every practical and didn't miss one, though I did have a few late submissions.
