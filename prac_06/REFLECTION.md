# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started dedicating more structured time each week to review the lecture notes and work on practical exercises consistently. Rather than cramming before deadlines, I’m now trying to tackle the work in smaller, manageable parts to improve my understanding and reduce stress.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to improve my approach to debugging and troubleshooting. I tend to rely too much on trial and error, which can be time-consuming. I’d like to start using more systematic strategies, like writing out pseudocode or commenting more frequently, to trace and resolve issues more effectively.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’ve been consistent with my weekly recently, which has really helped my confidence and understanding. I’ll keep this up because the regular practice.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop leaving the assignments until close to the due dates. This last-minute work approach adds unnecessary stress and doesn’t give me enough time to seek help if I get stuck. Instead, I’ll aim to start earlier.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

One suggestion would be to incorporate more by hand examples. I think seeing more by hand writing code applications would make the subject content feel more understandable and implanted in my mind.
